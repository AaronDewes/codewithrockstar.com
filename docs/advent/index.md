# Advent of Code 2019

Somebody suggested it might be fun to try and solve [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) using Rockstar... here. Hold my beer.

* [Day 1](day01/) - **solved**. Although I had to add arithmetic rounding to the language spec.
* [Day 2](day02/) â€“ in progress.
  * *temporarily derailed by some EPIC yak shaving, which is documented in [Adding Arrays to Rockstar](day02/adding_arrays_to_rockstar)*
* [Day 3](day03/) - coming soon
* [Day 3](day04/) - coming soon
