# Advent of Code 2019

Somebody suggested it might be fun to try and solve [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) using Rockstar... here. Hold my beer.

* [Day 1](day01/) - **solved**. Although I had to add arithmetic rounding to the language spec.
* [Day 2](day02/) â€“ **solved**. Ths one took a while because, um, Rockstar didn't have arrays. Or any kind of split 
operation. Or any kind of type conversion. But now it does. Read all about [Adding Arrays to Rockstar](day02/adding_arrays_to_rockstar)
* [Day 3](day03/) - coming soon
* [Day 3](day04/) - coming soon
