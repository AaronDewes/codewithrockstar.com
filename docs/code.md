## Implementations

You can find all the code for Rockstar at [github.com/dylanbeattie/rockstar](https://www.github.com/dylanbeattie/rockstar). 

Since the first release of the Rockstar specification in July 2018, numerous people around the web have created and published their own implementations of the language. Owing to the lack of a reference implementation or an official test suite, you may find inconsistencies between the behaviour of different versions of Rockstar. Try to think of this as part of the fun. 

Work is under way to create a reference implementation with a comprehensive test suite - if you're interested in getting involved, [the code is on GitHub](https://github.com/dylanbeattie/rockstar/tree/reference-implementation) and we hang out in the [Rockstar Developers chat on Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/xsQK7UU) 
Discord. Remember, though - it's a joke language that we're implementing partly as an exercise in programming language design, but mainly for the hell of it. Join us, have fun, and don't take any of this too seriously.
