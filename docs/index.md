## Introducing Rockstar
Rockstar is a Turing-complete computer programming language designed for creating programs that are also hair metal power ballads.

```
(modulus function in idiomatic Rockstar)

Midnight takes your heart and your soul
While your heart is as high as your soul
Put your heart without your soul into your heart

Give back your heart
```
Rockstar started life as a [tweet from Paul Stovell](https://twitter.com/paulstovell/status/1013960369465782273?lang=en):

The [Rockstar language specification](/spec) was created by <a href="https://www.dylanbeattie.net/">Dylan Beattie</a>, and there are [multiple open source implementations](/code) of the language. Rockstar has been [widely covered on the web](/news), including articles on BoingBoing and in Classic Rock magazine.
